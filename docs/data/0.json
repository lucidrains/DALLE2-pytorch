While the embeddings generated are ***close*** the image and text embeddings occupy two disjoint sets.\n```python\n# Load Models\nclip_model = clip.load(\"ViT-L/14\")\ndecoder = Decoder(checkpoint=\"best.pth\") # A decoder trained on CLIP Image embeddings\n# Retrieve prompt from user and encode with CLIP",
